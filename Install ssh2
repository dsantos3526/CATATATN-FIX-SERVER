# Install SSH2 For PHP Shell Connections

A general overview of SSH2 for PHP can be found at the official Secure Shell2 reference. If you look at the requirements section, you will see that two other libraries are required for it to work. They are OpenSSL and libssh2. I explain here how to install both of these first. And then we proceed to actually install ssh2 for PHP shell connections.

Installing OpenSSL
Run any of the following commands to determine if OpenSSL is already installed on your machine:

dpkg -l | grep -i openssl

apt-get install openssl

# Install Libssh
wget https://libssh2.org/download/libssh2-1.10.0.tar.gz
tar -zxvf libssh2-1.1.tar.gz
cd libssh2-1.1
./configure
make
make install

# Install 
# Create a build directory and untar the package:
wget https://pecl.php.net/get/ssh2-1.3.1.tgz
mkdir build-dir
mv ssh2-0.12.tgz build-dir
cd build-dir
tar xzvf ssh2-0.12.tgz

# Prepare the compile step and compile:
phpize
./configure --with-ssh2
make
make install

# Copy the module in the system (For 32 bit machine):
cp modules/ssh2.so /usr/lib/php/modules/ssh2.so

# Copy the module in the system (For 64 bit machine):
cp modules/ssh2.so /usr/lib64/php/modules/ssh2.so


cd ../../
rm -f build-dir




# Confirm that this file
# /etc/php.d/ssh2.ini
# includes this line:
extension=ssh2.so
